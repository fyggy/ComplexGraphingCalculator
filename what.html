    <div class="form">
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>In short: this site is a method of visualising functions on complex numbers. It takes gridlines
        and displays the transformation after the application of the inputted function. If this means nothing to you, then read on.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Complex numbers</h2>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>The complex numbers is an extension of the real numbers. The real numbers are numbers that we deal with
        every day, numbers like <span class="render">3, -2.45, \frac{2}{3}</span>or even<span class="render"> \pi</span>.
        However, they cannot do everything. In your life, you have probably squared a lot of numbers, and will have noticed that, if
        you square a number, it is always positive. The reason for this is quite simple: a positive number times a positive number is
        positive, and a negative number times a negative number is also a positive number. So now ask yourself: what is
        <span class="render">\sqrt{-1}</span>? Remember that the square root sign means "what number squared gives negative one".
        However, we just established that this is impossible, as any square number is positive. So that's just it then? Do we just say it
        doesn't exist? Well, mathematicians think not. What if we just made up a number that fits that description? All the other numbers
        are made up anyways, whats one more?. Lets call this new "imaginary" number <span class="render">i</span>, and so, the field of
        complex analysis was born.
    </p><br>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>We can add complex numbers and real numbers together, like anything else, but we cant simplify it like
        usual. For example, <span class="render">2+i</span> is just <span class="render">2+i</span>. We can also multiply
        <span class="render">i</span> by a real number, such as <span class="render">3i</span>. Thus, a complex number can be any number
        of the form <span class="render">a+bi</span> where <span class="render">a</span> and <span class="render">b</span> are both
        real numbers. Adding and multiplying complex numbers is exactly the same to how you perform operations with real numbers.
        Simply treat <span class="render">i</span> like a variable instead of a number. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="equation">
        <span class="render">(3-4i) + (7+12i) = (3+7) + (-4+12)i</span> <br>
        <span class="render" style="position: relative; left: 23px;">= 10+8i</span><br><br>
        <span class="render">(3-4i) \cdot (7+12i) = 3\cdot7-4i\cdot7+3\cdot12i-4i\cdot12i</span> <br>
        <span class="render" style="position: relative; left: 30.5px;">= 21-28i+36i-48{i}^{2}</span> <br>
        <span class="render" style="position: relative; left: -1px;">= 21+8i+48</span> <br>
        <span class="render" style="position: relative; right: 19px;">= 69+8i</span> <br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Visualisations</h2>


    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>Complex numbers can be thought of as coordinates on a 2-d plane. Take, for example, the number
        <span class="render">4+3i</span>. It can be visualised as the point 4 along and 3 up, like so.<br>
        <img src="media/threefour.png" width=451" height="339" alt="A grid with a point four along and three up"><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>Every point on a 2-d plane can be expressed this way, meaning that actually, in reality, the 2-d
        plane is actually just a bunch of complex numbers in disguise.
    </p> <br>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>Now, you might be wondering how we visualise a function of these
        numbers. But first, what is a function? Well, in simple terms, a function takes a number as input, and gives a number as an output.
        in some senses, it "transforms" this number into a different number. Working with real numbers, we can visualise this quite easily.
        All you need is 2 dimensions to properly visualise a function: one for the input, and one for the output. This is the traditional
        method to visualise functions. However, with complex numbers, this is not possible. We already needed 2 dimensions to display a single complex
        number, how are we going to visualise the connection between 2 of them? The only way to do this seems to be to use 4 dimensions, which the average
        human cannot comprehend properly.
    </p> <br>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>This is the motivation behind this program. Here, we cheat by not explicitly showing the input point. Instead,
        we convey the information by calling the function on every point on the plane, and then display the shape that it makes afterwards. To show the shape
        of the plane, we show the way that the gridlines change. To preserve some of the input information, the lines move from the initial state
        before transformation, to the final state after transformation.
    </p> <br>
    <p class="explain">
        <span class="tab"></span>As an example, take the function<span class="render">f(x)=x^2</span>. On the real number line, this method is not very
        interesting, looking like this:
        <img src="media/realTransformation.png" alt="The transformation of a number line to its transformed equivalent. Top looks like a normal number line,
bottom looks like a number line but the marks consistently get further away from each other." style="width: 800px; height: auto; margin: 0;"><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>However, using complex numbers, the transformation now looks like this:
        <img src="media/complexTransformation.gif" alt="The transformation of gridlines to its transformed equivalent. Left looks like many lines, Right looks like
many parabolas intersecting"><br>
        <span class="tab"></span>This program allows you to visualise the transformation under any function, from any set of input gridlines. This is not the
        only way to visualise complex functions, but it allows for noticing similarities between 2 functions, and is quite intuitive.
